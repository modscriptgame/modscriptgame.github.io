Summary:
<br />
<br />
                    Modscript is an old-school arcade speed shooter. The game went through many different iterations in order to get the desired balance between competitive speed running, and ease of use. During development, the game was advised by Patrick Fortier (Gameplay Director at Eidos Montreal). The game is about emulating the arcade FPS era, while making the player feel like a cybernetic speed power house.

What went right?
<br />
<br />
                    The gameâ€™s speedrunning turned out as intended, with supporting level design, enemy behaviors, and UI for ease of use. The initial development cycle and schedule of the project was near on point, with all the tasks and timelines accurately estimated to provide ample amounts of time for implementing iterative features. Another plus for the project was the amount of time dedicated to QA test the game and respond to feedback. In general, the project was a success!

What went wrong?
<br />
<br />
                    Since this was my first time working in javascript, there were plenty of limitations that needed to be worked around. For instance, had I known about how the initial code was structured I could have given the game another level of polish with UI, feedback, and bonus features. Additionally, the amount of time invested in iterative design led to stretch goals for engaging the community. Marketing and community building were prioritized less on the task list, making balancing competitive play harder than originally anticipated.

Do-Overs?
<br />
<br />
                    Although the marketing tasks were less prioritized, it would have been beneficial to create more of a plan, as a stretch goal. Doing so would have helped with balancing competitive play, and ultimately would have stimulated the community more. Additionally, at the beginning of the development cycle, devoting more time to researching what was possible with the library would have helped with polish later on. Researching and having a more thorough knowledge of the tools in use, would have made the overall sprint cycle, and iterative process easier. 
<br />
<br />
Other than that, the game turned out nicely with a small but invested speedrunning community.
